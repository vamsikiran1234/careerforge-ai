## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Issues in Quiz Tests
**Problem**: Quiz tests were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors
**Root Cause**: Tests were not including JWT authentication tokens
**Solution**: 
- Added `generateTestToken()` import from testUtils
- Added `Authorization: Bearer ${authToken}` header to all quiz test requests
- Updated user mocking to match authentication middleware expectations

### 2. Outdated Test Expectations
**Problem**: One test expected 400 error for missing userId in request body
**Root Cause**: Quiz controller was updated to use JWT authentication instead of request body userId
**Solution**: Updated test to reflect current implementation - testing for user not found in database instead

### 3. User Email Mocking
**Problem**: Tests were mocking wrong user email for authentication
**Solution**: Updated mocks to use `test@example.com` to match JWT token payload

## Files Modified

### tests/quiz.test.js
- Added JWT authentication token generation
- Added Authorization headers to all test requests
- Updated user mocking for authentication middleware
- Fixed test expectations to match current controller implementation
