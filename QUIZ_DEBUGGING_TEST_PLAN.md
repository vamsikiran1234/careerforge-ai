# Quiz Debugging Test Plan - Immediate Action Required 🚨

## 🎯 **Current Status**

I've added **comprehensive debugging** and **temporarily forced the system to use fallback questions only** to isolate the issue. This will help us determine if the problem is with:

1. **AI Service** (not generating different questions)
2. **Progression Logic** (not advancing through questions)
3. **Database Updates** (not saving progress)
4. **Frontend State** (not updating UI)

## 🧪 **Test Setup Applied**

### **Forced Fallback Testing**
```javascript
// TEMPORARY: Force fallback to test progression logic
console.log(`🧪 TESTING: Forcing fallback to test progression logic`);
throw new Error('Testing fallback system');
```

This bypasses the AI entirely and uses only the predefined question bank to test if the progression logic works.

## 📋 **Testing Instructions**

### **Step 1: Restart Server & Take Quiz**
1. **Restart your server** (`npm run dev`)
2. **Go to the quiz page** and start a new assessment
3. **Answer the first question** and click "Next"
4. **Watch the server console** for debug output
5. **Check if the question changes** on the frontend

### **Step 2: Analyze Server Logs**

Look for these specific log patterns:

#### **🔍 Expected Debug Output**
```bash
# When you click "Next", you should see:
🎯 Calling aiService.quizNext for session [ID] with answer: "[YOUR_ANSWER]"

🔍 Quiz Progress Debug: {
  sessionId: '[SESSION_ID]',
  currentStage: 'SKILLS_ASSESSMENT',
  currentStageIndex: 0,
  currentStageAnswers: 1,
  requiredForStage: 4,
  isCurrentStageComplete: false,
  questionCount: 1,
  userAnswer: 'provided',
  allStageAnswers: ['SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: 1']
}

💾 Added answer to SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: { question: "...", answer: "...", ... }
📊 Current answers for SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: 1

🧪 TESTING: Forcing fallback to test progression logic

🛡️ Fallback System Debug: {
  nextStage: 'SKILLS_ASSESSMENT',
  stageAnswers: 1,
  questionIndex: 1,
  availableQuestions: 4,
  allAnswers: ['SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: 1']
}

📝 Selected fallback question 2/4 for SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: "How would you rate your experience with web..."

📝 AI Service returned: {
  type: 'question',
  stage: 'SKILLS_ASSESSMENT',
  isComplete: false,
  questionPreview: 'How would you rate your experience with web...'
}
```

### **Step 3: Identify the Issue**

#### **✅ If Questions Progress (Good!)**
- You should see **different questions** after clicking "Next"
- **Question counter should advance** (Question 2 of 5, etc.)
- **Progress bar should move**
- **Server logs show increasing questionIndex**

#### **❌ If Questions Don't Progress (Issue Found!)**
Look for these problems in the logs:

**Problem 1: Same questionIndex**
```bash
📝 Selected fallback question 1/4 for SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: "What programming languages..."
# After clicking Next multiple times, still shows:
📝 Selected fallback question 1/4 for SKILLS_ASSESSMENT: "What programming languages..."
```

**Problem 2: Answers not being saved**
```bash
🔍 Quiz Progress Debug: {
  currentStageAnswers: 0,  # Should increase with each answer
  allStageAnswers: []      # Should show answers being added
}
```

**Problem 3: Database not updating**
```bash
# Missing or error in database update logs
```

## 🔧 **Immediate Fixes Based on Results**

### **If questionIndex is not advancing:**
The issue is in the fallback question selection logic.

### **If answers are not being saved:**
The issue is in the answer storage logic.

### **If database is not updating:**
The issue is in the database update logic.

### **If frontend is not updating:**
The issue is in the API response or frontend state management.

## 📊 **Additional Debug Commands**

### **Check Database Directly**
```sql
-- Check current session state
SELECT id, currentStage, answers, createdAt 
FROM QuizSession 
WHERE id = '[SESSION_ID]';

-- Check questions generated
SELECT id, questionText, stage, "order", userAnswer 
FROM QuizQuestion 
WHERE quizSessionId = '[SESSION_ID]' 
ORDER BY "order";
```

### **Frontend Console Check**
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Quiz Store:', useQuizStore.getState());
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the test** with the debugging enabled
2. **Share the server console output** when you click "Next"
3. **Tell me what you observe**:
   - Does the question change?
   - What do the server logs show?
   - Does the progress bar move?

Based on the debug output, I'll be able to **pinpoint the exact issue** and provide a targeted fix.

## 🔄 **After Testing**

Once we identify the issue, I'll:
1. **Remove the forced fallback** 
2. **Fix the specific problem** identified
3. **Re-enable the AI system**
4. **Ensure both AI and fallback work correctly**

**Please run this test now and share the server console output!** 🔍
