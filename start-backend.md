# 🚀 Start Backend Server for Real Progress Data

## Current Issue
The progress charts are showing **fallback/sample data** because the backend server is not running.

## ✅ Solution: Start Backend Server

### Step 1: Open Terminal in Root Directory
```bash
# Make sure you're in the root directory (not frontend/)
cd /path/to/careerforge-ai
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify Server is Running
You should see output like:
```
✅ Groq AI provider initialized
✅ Gemini AI provider initialized  
🚀 CareerForge AI server running on port 3000
📊 Environment: development
🔗 Health check: http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Step 4: Test Backend Connection
Open browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000/health`

You should see:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "CareerForge AI API is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-...",
  "environment": "development"
}
```

## 🎯 After Backend Starts

1. **Refresh the career goal page**
2. **Look for "Live Data" indicator** (green checkmark)
3. **Charts should now show real progress data**
4. **Try "Update Progress" button** to test real-time updates

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Backend Won't Start:
- Check if port 3000 is already in use
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Check for any error messages in terminal

### If Still Showing Sample Data:
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify you're logged in (authentication required)
- Try the "Retry" button in the yellow banner
- Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Common Issues:
1. **Port 3000 in use**: Kill other processes or change port
2. **Database connection**: Ensure database is running
3. **Environment variables**: Check .env file exists
4. **Authentication**: Make sure you're logged in

## 📊 Expected Behavior with Real Data

### New Goals (0% progress):
- Shows "Goal Created" baseline
- Current status point
- Minimal but real data structure

### Goals with Progress:
- Shows actual progress timeline
- Real milestone completion events  
- Dynamic insights based on actual data

### After Progress Updates:
- Charts refresh automatically
- New data points appear
- Trend analysis updates in real-time

## 🎉 Success Indicators

- ✅ **"Live Data"** badge appears (green checkmark)
- ✅ **No yellow warning banner**
- ✅ **Console shows successful API calls**
- ✅ **Progress updates work in real-time**
- ✅ **Charts show actual goal data**
