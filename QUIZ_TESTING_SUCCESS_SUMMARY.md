## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Testing

### 1. AI Service Failure on Submit ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** 500 error when submitting quiz answer  
**Cause:** No fallback when AI service unavailable  
**Fix:** Added try-catch wrapper with basic recommendations fallback  
**File:** `src/controllers/quizController.js` (lines 263-308)

### 2. Parameter Name Mismatch ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** GET /results/:sessionId couldn't find session  
**Cause:** Controller expected `quizId`, route used `sessionId`  
**Fix:** Accept both parameter names  
**File:** `src/controllers/quizController.js` (line 388)

### 3. Schema Field Error on Retake ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Retake endpoint returned 500 error  
**Cause:** Using non-existent schema fields  
**Fix:** Updated to use correct schema fields  
**File:** `src/routes/quizRoutes.js` (lines 119-173)
