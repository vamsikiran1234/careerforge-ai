# Real AI Implementation Restored - Complete ✅

## 🚨 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. ReferenceError: userAnswer is not defined**
**Location**: `src/services/aiService.js:186`
**Cause**: The fallback function was referencing `userAnswer` variable that wasn't passed as parameter
**Fix**: Removed all fallback system code that was causing the error

### **2. Fallback System Removed**
**Request**: Use only real AI implementation, not fallback questions
**Action**: Completely removed all fallback-related code and functions

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### **✅ Restored Real AI Implementation**
```javascript
// Now using only real Groq AI with multi-model fallback
const { response, modelUsed, attemptNumber } = await callGroqWithFallback([
  { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
  { 
    role: 'user', 
    content: userAnswer ? 
      `User answered: "${userAnswer}". Please provide the next step.` : 
      'Please start the quiz with the first question.'
  },
]);
```

### **✅ Removed All Fallback Code**
- ❌ `getStageBasedFallbackQuestion()` function - REMOVED
- ❌ `generateFallbackRecommendations()` function - REMOVED  
- ❌ Predefined question banks - REMOVED
- ❌ Fallback error handling - REMOVED

### **✅ Enhanced Error Handling**
```javascript
// Now throws proper errors instead of using fallbacks
if (error.code === 'all_models_failed') {
  throw new Error('AI service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.');
}

if (error.message.includes('quota')) {
  throw new Error('AI service quota exceeded. Please try again later.');
}
```
