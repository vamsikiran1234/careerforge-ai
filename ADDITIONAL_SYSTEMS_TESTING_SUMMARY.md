## Technical Notes

### Why Some Systems Need Chat Context:

1. **Reactions System**
   - Reactions are tied to AI chat messages
   - Requires valid sessionId and messageId
   - Testing requires creating a chat session first

2. **Share System**
   - Shares conversation history
   - Requires valid chat sessionId
   - Testing requires active chat conversation

### To Fully Test Context-Dependent Systems:

1. Create AI chat session: `POST /api/v1/chat`
2. Send messages to get sessionId and messageId
3. Use those IDs to test reactions and share
4. This would be part of integration testing
