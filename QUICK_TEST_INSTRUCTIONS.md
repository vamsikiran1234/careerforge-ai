## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- ✅ Frontend running on: http://localhost:5174/
- ✅ Backend running on: http://localhost:3000/
- ✅ Two different email accounts ready for testing

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Test Procedure

### **Part 1: Setup & Verify Fix is Active**

1. **Open the Application**
   ```
   http://localhost:5174/
   ```

2. **Open Browser DevTools**
   - Press `F12` or `Right-click → Inspect`
   - Go to **Console** tab
   - Go to **Application** tab

3. **Copy & Run Test Script**
   - Open the Console tab
   - Copy contents from: `frontend/public/test-chat-security.js`
   - Paste into Console and press Enter
   - You'll see a colorful test report

### **Part 2: Test with User A (Your Gmail Account)**

4. **Login as User A**
   ```
   Email: vamsikiran198@gmail.com
   Password: [your password]
   ```

5. **Check LocalStorage (Before Sessions)**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage → http://localhost:5174
   - Look for `chat-storage` key
   - **Expected**: Either empty or has old sessions

6. **Create New Chat Sessions**
   - Go to "AI Chat" page
   - Create 3-4 different chat sessions:
     - "What is software engineering?"
     - "Career advice for beginners"
     - "How to learn Python?"
     - "Best programming languages 2025"
   - Note the session titles in the left sidebar

7. **Verify Sessions in LocalStorage**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - Click on `chat-storage`
   - **Expected**: You should see JSON with your sessions

8. **Logout User A**
   - Click Logout button
   - **WATCH THE CONSOLE** - Should see: `✅ Cleared chat-storage on logout to prevent data leakage`

9. **Verify LocalStorage is Cleared**
   - DevTools → Application → Local Storage
   - **CRITICAL CHECK**: `chat-storage` key should be **GONE**
   - Run test script again in console
   - **Expected**: "No chat storage found (clean state or logged out)"

---

### **Part 3: Test with User B (Different Account)**

10. **Login as User B (Different Email)**
    ```
    Create new account OR use:
    Email: test@example.com
    Password: [create new or use existing]
    ```

11. **Go to AI Chat Page**
    - Navigate to the AI Chat section
    - **CRITICAL CHECK**: Sidebar should be EMPTY or only show welcome message
    - **VERIFY**: You should NOT see ANY of User A's sessions:
      - ❌ NO "What is software engineering?"
      - ❌ NO "Career advice for beginners"
      - ❌ NO "How to learn Python?"
      - ❌ NO "Best programming languages 2025"

12. **Create Sessions for User B**
    - Create 1-2 new chat sessions:
      - "I want to be a data scientist"
      - "Tell me about AI careers"
    - **Expected**: Only see User B's new sessions in sidebar

13. **Run Test Script Again**
    - Open Console
    - Paste test script
    - **Expected**: Should show User B's sessions only

---

### **Part 4: Verify User A Sessions Still Exist**

14. **Logout User B**
    - Click Logout
    - **WATCH CONSOLE** for clearing message

15. **Login Back as User A**
    ```
    Email: vamsikiran198@gmail.com
    ```

16. **Check User A's Sessions**
    - Go to AI Chat
    - **Expected**: See ONLY User A's original 4 sessions
    - **VERIFY**: Do NOT see User B's sessions:
      - ❌ NO "I want to be a data scientist"
      - ❌ NO "Tell me about AI careers"

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Test **PASSES** if:
- ✅ `chat-storage` is removed from localStorage on logout
- ✅ Console shows clearing message on logout
- ✅ User B sees NO sessions from User A
- ✅ User A sees NO sessions from User B
- ✅ Each user only sees their own chat history
- ✅ Test script reports all tests passed

### Test **FAILS** if:
- ❌ `chat-storage` remains in localStorage after logout
- ❌ User B can see User A's chat sessions
- ❌ Sessions are mixed between users
- ❌ Console errors appear

---

## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still seeing other user's sessions
**Solution**:
1. Open Console
2. Run: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Re-test

### Problem: Fix not working
**Solution**:
1. Check if you have the latest code
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Restart dev server

### Problem: Backend errors
**Solution**:
1. Check backend is running: http://localhost:3000/health
2. Check backend console for errors
3. Verify database is accessible

## 📸 Screenshot Checklist

Please capture these screenshots:

1. ✅ User A's sessions in sidebar (before logout)
2. ✅ LocalStorage showing `chat-storage` (User A logged in)
3. ✅ Console showing clearing message on logout
4. ✅ LocalStorage with `chat-storage` REMOVED (after logout)
5. ✅ User B's empty/clean sidebar (no User A sessions)
6. ✅ Test script results showing all tests passed

---

## 🎬 Video Testing (Optional)

Record a quick screen recording showing:
1. Login as User A → Create sessions → Logout
2. LocalStorage clearing
3. Login as User B → Verify clean slate
4. No session leakage

---

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- **Quick Test**: 5 minutes (just verify no leakage)
- **Full Test**: 10-15 minutes (all steps with screenshots)
- **Comprehensive**: 20 minutes (with multiple users and documentation)
