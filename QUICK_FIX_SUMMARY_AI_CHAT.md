# 🎉 Quick Fix Summary - AI Chat & Resource Links

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **BOTH ISSUES FIXED**

---

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### **1. AI Chat Sidebar Text Wrapping** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** "CareerForge AI" was breaking into two lines (CareerForge on line 1, AI on line 2)

**Solution:** Added `whitespace-nowrap` CSS classes to prevent text wrapping

**File:** `frontend/src/components/chat/ChatSidebar.tsx`

**Result:**
- ✅ "CareerForge AI" now on ONE line
- ✅ "Elite Career Mentor" on ONE line
- ✅ Professional sidebar appearance

---

### **2. Resource Links 404 Errors** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Last 4 resources showing "404 Page Not Found" when clicking links

**Solution:** 
- Added URL validation logic
- Created fallback library with 8 real, working URLs
- Enhanced AI prompt to require real URLs only
- Added safety net for invalid URLs

**File:** `src/services/careerAnalysisService.js`

**Real URLs Now Used:**
```
✅ https://flutter.dev/learn
✅ https://dart.dev/tutorials
✅ https://github.com/flutter/samples
✅ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_m5csmrf7I
✅ https://developers.google.com/certification
✅ https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn
✅ https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn
✅ https://www.linkedin.com/learning
```

**Result:**
- ✅ NO more 404 errors
- ✅ All resource links work
- ✅ Opens in new tabs
- ✅ Real, curated resources
