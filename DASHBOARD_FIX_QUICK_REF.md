## 📋 Quick Test Checklist

Open: http://localhost:5174/dashboard

### Check These:
- [ ] Orange warning banner is GONE
- [ ] Chat Sessions shows your actual count
- [ ] Quizzes Taken shows your actual count
- [ ] Weekly Activity chart has data
- [ ] Skills Assessment chart displays
- [ ] No red errors in console (F12)
- [ ] Network tab shows 200 OK for /dashboard/stats

## 🐛 If Still Broken

### 1. Hard Refresh Browser
```
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
```

### 2. Check Both Servers Running
```bash
# Backend should be on port 3000
# Frontend should be on port 5174
```

### 3. Check Console for New Errors
```
F12 → Console tab
Look for any red errors
```

### 4. Test API Directly
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/dashboard/stats', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('token')}`
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => console.log('API Response:', data));
```

Should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... }
}
```
