## ✅ What I Did

### 1. Checked Documentation ✅
- ✅ Reviewed `docs/improved-prompts.md` for quiz specifications
- ✅ Checked `docs/step-14-frontend-development-plan.md` for implementation plan
- ✅ Found complete AI prompt specifications for 5-stage assessment
- ✅ Verified all stages are defined: SKILLS_ASSESSMENT, CAREER_INTERESTS, PERSONALITY_TRAITS, LEARNING_STYLE, CAREER_GOALS

### 2. Analyzed All Code ✅
Carefully reviewed every file in the quiz system:
- ✅ `src/controllers/quizController.js` (390 lines)
- ✅ `src/services/aiService.js` (1057 lines)
- ✅ `src/utils/quizUtils.js` (236 lines)
- ✅ `frontend/src/store/quiz.ts` (207 lines)
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/quiz/*.tsx` (multiple files)
- ✅ `prisma/schema.prisma` (database models)

### 3. Found & Fixed 4 Critical Issues ✅

**Issue #1**: JSON Parsing Error (CRITICAL)
- Location: `aiService.js` line 282, `quizUtils.js` line 123
- Problem: `session.answers` is a string, was treated as object
- Fix: Added proper `JSON.parse()` with type checking
- Impact: Blocked ALL quiz functionality

**Issue #2**: Prisma Relation Mismatch (CRITICAL)
- Location: `quizController.js` line 37
- Problem: Used `questions` instead of `quizQuestions`
- Fix: Changed to correct relation name from schema
- Impact: Prevented session resumption

**Issue #3**: Missing Error Handling (HIGH)
- Location: `quizController.js` multiple locations
- Problem: No try-catch blocks around AI calls
- Fix: Added comprehensive error handling with logging
- Impact: Server crashes and poor error messages

**Issue #4**: Null Reference Errors (MEDIUM)
- Location: `QuizInterface.tsx` line 101
- Problem: Frontend crashed when question was null
- Fix: Added null check with loading state
- Impact: Frontend crashes on edge cases

### 4. Added Professional Features ✅
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages to frontend
- ✅ Strategic logging for debugging
- ✅ Input validation throughout
- ✅ Database cleanup utility (`scripts/cleanupQuizSessions.js`)
