## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Role Switcher Not Showing

**Symptom**: Header doesn't show role switcher dropdown

**Possible Causes**:
1. User only has one role
2. RoleContext not loaded
3. Component mounting issue

**How to Debug**:
```javascript
// In Console:
// Check available roles
const authStorage = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('auth-storage'))
console.log('User:', authStorage.state.user)

// Check if mentor
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mentorship/profile', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${authStorage.state.token}` }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('Mentor Status:', d))
```

**Solution**:
- If user has only STUDENT role → No switcher (expected)
- If user IS mentor but no switcher → Check mentor profile status
- If status is PENDING → Should still show switcher
- If status is REJECTED → Won't show mentor option

---

### Issue 2: "Access Denied" When Accessing Mentor Portal

**Symptom**: Can't access `/mentor/*` routes, see "Access Denied" modal

**Possible Causes**:
1. User is not a mentor
2. Mentor status is REJECTED
3. Token expired

**How to Debug**:
```javascript
// Check mentor profile
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mentorship/profile', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${yourToken}` }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('Profile:', d))

// Check response:
// - 404 = Not a mentor
// - 200 with status ACTIVE/PENDING = Should work
// - 200 with status REJECTED = Won't have access
```

**Solution**:
- Register as mentor: `/mentorship/register`
- Wait for admin approval
- Once approved, refresh role: Logout and login again

---

### Issue 3: Badges Not Updating

**Symptom**: Pending count badge stuck at 0 or wrong number

**Possible Causes**:
1. API not returning correct data
2. Auto-refresh not working
3. Connection/session data missing

**How to Debug**:
```javascript
// Check API response
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/mentorship/connections?status=PENDING', {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${yourToken}` }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('Pending Requests:', d.data.length))
```

**Solution**:
- Create test connection request
- Check API returns correct count
- Badge updates every 60s (or page refresh)

---

### Issue 4: Role Not Persisting

**Symptom**: Role resets to STUDENT after refresh

**Possible Causes**:
1. localStorage being cleared
2. RoleContext not loading saved role
3. Browser privacy mode

**How to Debug**:
```javascript
// Check stored role
localStorage.getItem('currentRole')

// Should return: 'STUDENT', 'MENTOR', or 'ADMIN'
// If null → Not being saved
```

**Solution**:
- Disable browser privacy mode
- Check localStorage is enabled
- Clear cache and retry

---

### Issue 5: Wrong Page After Role Switch

**Symptom**: Switch to Mentor Portal but stays on current page

**Expected**: Should navigate to `/mentor/dashboard`

**How to Debug**:
```javascript
// Check switchRole function is working
// After clicking Mentor Portal:
console.log(window.location.pathname) // Should be /mentor/dashboard
```

**Solution**:
- Check navigation in RoleContext
- Check ProtectedMentorRoute is working
- Try manual navigation: Type `/mentor/dashboard` in browser
