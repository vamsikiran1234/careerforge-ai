## üîß Backend Integration

### API Endpoints Used:
```
GET    /api/v1/mentorship/connections       - Get all connections
POST   /api/v1/mentorship/connections/:id/accept  - Accept request
POST   /api/v1/mentorship/connections/:id/decline - Decline request
DELETE /api/v1/mentorship/connections/:id   - Delete connection
```

### State Management:
**Store**: `frontend/src/store/mentors.ts` (needs to be created or extended)

The pages use standard `useState` and `useEffect` with Axios for API calls.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Authentication Required:
Both pages are **protected routes** - users must be logged in to access them.

### Role-Based Access:
- `/connections` - Available to all logged-in users
- `/mentor/connections` - Should check for MENTOR role (currently accessible to all)

### Future Enhancement Needed:
Consider adding role-based route protection:
```tsx
// In App.tsx, wrap mentor routes:
{user?.role === 'MENTOR' && (
  <Route path="mentor/connections" element={<MentorConnections />} />
)}
```

1. ‚úÖ Test connection request flow end-to-end
2. ‚úÖ Verify email notifications are sent
3. ‚úÖ Check that chat rooms are created on acceptance
4. ‚úÖ Test capacity limits (3 mentees max)
5. üöÄ Move to **Phase 3: Real-Time Chat System**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "My Connections" link not showing in sidebar?
**Fix**: Clear browser cache and refresh. The link was just added to Sidebar.tsx.

### Getting "Authentication required" error?
**Fix**: Make sure you're logged in. Check `localStorage` for 'auth-storage' key.

### Pages showing as blank?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify React lazy loading is working
3. Check that files exist in `frontend/src/components/connections/`

### No connections showing?
1. Make sure you've sent/received connection requests
2. Check the correct tab (Pending/Active/Declined)
3. Verify backend API is running on the correct port

## üìû Support

If pages are not appearing:
1. Check that frontend dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify routes are registered in `App.tsx` (lines 196-219)
4. Check that lazy imports are correct (lines 26-27)
