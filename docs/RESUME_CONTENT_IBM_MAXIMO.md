## SUGGESTED COVER LETTER SNIPPET:

*"While my primary backend experience is with Node.js and Python, I've architected enterprise-grade systems following the same principles used in Java/Spring Boot applications—RESTful API design, microservices architecture, ORM-based database access (Prisma/JPA equivalent), and comprehensive testing. My extensive DevOps experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines, combined with strong SQL/NoSQL database skills and Agile methodology expertise, positions me well to contribute to the Maximo Application Suite team. I'm excited to leverage my backend development foundation while expanding into Java and enterprise frameworks like those used in IBM's tech stack."*
