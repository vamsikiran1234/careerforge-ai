DELETE /api/v1/chat/reactions/:id   - Remove reaction
GET    /api/v1/chat/reactions/:sessionId - Get all reactions for session
```

### **Database Schema**
```prisma
model MessageReaction {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  sessionId    String
  messageId    String
  userId       String
  reactionType String   // 'THUMBS_UP', 'THUMBS_DOWN', 'BOOKMARK', 'STAR'
  feedback     String?  // Optional text feedback
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())
  
  // Relations
  user          User          @relation(...)
  careerSession CareerSession @relation(..., onDelete: Cascade)
  
  // Unique constraint
  @@unique([userId, sessionId, messageId, reactionType])
}
```
