# Quick Testing Guide - Mentor Connection Flow Fix

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. **403 Error** - "You must have an active connection"
**Problem**: Button labeled "Request Connection" was directly trying to book sessions  
**Fixed**: Now properly sends connection request first, waits for approval, then allows booking

### 2. **Session Type Confusion** - Chat vs Messages
**Clarified**: 
- **Messages (Sidebar)**: Async real-time chat for quick questions anytime
- **Chat Session**: Scheduled 30/60 min mentorship session via text with agenda

## üìä Database States to Check

### In Prisma Studio (http://localhost:5555)

**MentorConnection Table**:
- `status`: Must be `ACCEPTED` for booking to work
- `mentorId`: ID of the mentor
- `studentId`: Your user ID
- `acceptedAt`: Should have timestamp when accepted

**MentorSession Table** (after booking):
- `mentorId`: Mentor's profile ID
- `studentId`: Your user ID  
- `status`: Should be `SCHEDULED`
- `meetingLink`: Should have Jitsi URL
- `scheduledAt`: Your selected date/time

---

## üêõ If You Still See Errors

### Console Logs to Check
Open browser DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console:

**When opening mentor profile**:
```javascript
// Should see connection status check
üîç Checking connection status for mentor: {mentorId}
‚úÖ Connection found: ACCEPTED
// OR
‚ÑπÔ∏è No existing connection found
```

**When clicking button**:
- "Request Connection" ‚Üí Opens modal, no navigation
- "Book Session" ‚Üí Navigates to `/sessions/book/{mentorId}`
- Pending/Declined ‚Üí No action (button disabled)

### Backend Logs to Check
Look in backend terminal for:

**Connection Request**:
```
POST /api/v1/mentorship/connections/request
Status: 200
Connection created with status: PENDING
```

**Session Booking**:
```
POST /api/v1/sessions/book
Checking connection for student: {studentId} with mentor: {mentorId}
‚úÖ Connection found: ACCEPTED
Session created successfully
```

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: Still seeing 403**
- Check connection status in database
- Must be `ACCEPTED`, not `PENDING`
- Refresh browser after changing status

**Issue 2: Button still says "Request Connection" but connection exists**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check console for connection fetch errors
- Verify token is valid

**Issue 3: BookingModal not opening**
- Check console for errors
- Verify `handleRequestConnection` is being called
- Check if `showBooking` state is updating
