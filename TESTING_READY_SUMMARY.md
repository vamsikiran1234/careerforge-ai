## 📋 What Was Fixed

### The Bug:
When you (vamsikiran198@gmail.com) logged out and another user logged in, they could see YOUR 4 chat sessions. This was a critical privacy violation.

### The Fix:
**3 layers of security implemented:**

1. **Clear on Logout** 🧹
   - File: `frontend/src/store/auth.ts`
   - When logout happens, `chat-storage` is completely removed from localStorage
   - Console message: `✅ Cleared chat-storage on logout to prevent data leakage`

2. **Clear Before Load** 🔄
   - File: `frontend/src/store/chat.ts` 
   - Before loading sessions from API, clear any old data first
   - Prevents mixing data from different users

3. **API is Source of Truth** 🎯
   - File: `frontend/src/store/chat.ts`
   - Don't merge with localStorage anymore
   - Only use sessions from backend API (which filters by user ID)
   - Only preserve temporary (unsaved) sessions

## 🧪 How to Test

### Quick Test (3 steps):

1. **Login with your Gmail**
   - Email: vamsikiran198@gmail.com
   - Go to AI Chat, create 2-3 sessions

2. **Logout and check DevTools**
   - Press F12 → Application → Local Storage
   - Verify `chat-storage` is REMOVED
   - Console should show: "✅ Cleared chat-storage..."

3. **Login with different email**
   - Use test@example.com or create new account
   - Go to AI Chat
   - **VERIFY**: You should NOT see vamsikiran198's sessions!
