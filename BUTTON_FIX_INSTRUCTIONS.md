# Career Trajectory Buttons Fix Instructions

## Problem Identified
The buttons in the career trajectory modals (Add Resource, Update Resource, Add Skill, Update Skill, Add Milestone, etc.) are not working because **the user needs to be authenticated** to access the career features.

## Backend Status ✅
- Backend server is running correctly on port 3000
- All API endpoints are working properly
- Authentication system is functional
- Test user has been created successfully

## Frontend Status ✅
- Frontend server is running on port 5173
- All modal components are implemented correctly
- No syntax errors in the code
- API client is configured properly

## Root Cause
The buttons fail because the frontend doesn't have a valid authentication token stored in localStorage.

## Quick Fix Solutions

### Option 1: Use Quick Login Page (Recommended)
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/quick-login`
2. Click "Login as Test User" button
3. You'll be automatically logged in and redirected to the career page
4. All buttons should now work properly

### Option 2: Browser Console Login
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/test-auth.js`
4. The script will automatically log you in
5. Refresh the page and navigate to career features

### Option 3: Manual Login
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/login`
2. Use these credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPass123!`
3. After login, navigate to career features

## Test Credentials
- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: TestPass123!
- **User ID**: cmh5502i60000uiy0awjw3d79
- **Roles**: ["STUDENT"]

## Verification Steps
After logging in, test these buttons:
1. **Add Learning Resource** - Should create new resources
2. **Update Resource** - Should edit existing resources  
3. **Add Skill Gap** - Should create new skills
4. **Update Skill** - Should edit existing skills
5. **Add Milestone** - Should create new milestones
6. **Update Milestone** - Should edit existing milestones

## API Endpoints Confirmed Working
- ✅ POST /api/v1/career/goals
- ✅ GET /api/v1/career/goals
- ✅ POST /api/v1/career/goals/:id/resources
- ✅ PUT /api/v1/career/goals/:id/resources/:resourceId
- ✅ POST /api/v1/career/goals/:id/skills
- ✅ PUT /api/v1/career/goals/:id/skills/:skillId
- ✅ POST /api/v1/career/goals/:id/milestones
- ✅ PUT /api/v1/career/goals/:id/milestones/:milestoneId

## Next Steps
1. Use one of the login methods above
2. Navigate to `/app/career`
3. Create a career goal if none exists
4. Test all the modal buttons
5. All functionality should work as expected

The issue was **authentication**, not the button implementations. All the modal components and API endpoints are working correctly!
