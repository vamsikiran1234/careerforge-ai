## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS

### 1. **Dark Theme Support** ‚úì

#### Problem:
Dashboard, Career Quiz, and Find Mentors pages were not properly styled for dark mode, causing poor contrast and readability issues in dark theme.

#### Solution:
Added comprehensive `dark:` classes to all three pages:

**Dashboard Page (`DashboardPage.tsx`):**
- Header text: `text-gray-900 dark:text-white`
- Description text: `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400`
- Stats cards: All icons, numbers, and labels now have dark variants
- Progress bars: `bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700`, `bg-blue-600 dark:bg-blue-500`
- Achievement badges: `bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-900/30`
- Status badges: `bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-900/30 text-green-800 dark:text-green-400`
- Getting Started guide: All headings and descriptions with dark classes

**Career Quiz Page (`QuizPage.tsx`):**
- Hero section: Header, description, icon backgrounds
- Feature cards: All three cards (Skills, Interest, Career Matching)
- Icon backgrounds: `bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-900/30`
- Bullet points: `bg-blue-600 dark:bg-blue-400`
- Text hierarchy: All headings and descriptions

**Find Mentors Page (`MentorsPage.tsx`):**
- Header and description
- Stats cards: All 4 cards with icons and numbers
- Search results text
- Empty state message
- All icon colors with dark variants

#### Result:
‚úÖ All three pages now fully support dark mode with proper contrast
‚úÖ Consistent styling across light and dark themes

### 2. **Settings Page Simplification** ‚úì

#### Problem:
Settings page had unnecessary features and complexity:
- "System" theme option (not implemented in ThemeContext)
- Privacy tab with generic features not relevant to platform
- Delete Account button (dangerous without proper implementation)
- Avatar upload button (not functional)

#### Solution:
Simplified settings to 4 essential tabs with platform-relevant features:

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå Privacy tab (generic, not platform-specific)
- ‚ùå System theme option (kept Light/Dark only)
- ‚ùå Delete Account button (requires backend implementation)
- ‚ùå Profile visibility settings (not yet implemented)
- ‚ùå Data usage toggles (not yet implemented)

**Kept & Improved:**
1. **Profile Tab:**
   - Name, Email, Bio editing
   - Avatar display (upload button removed until implemented)
   - Clean, professional form layout

2. **Security Tab (renamed from Account):**
   - Current password field with placeholder
   - New password field with requirements hint
   - Confirm password field with placeholder
   - Password strength indicator message
   - Clear focus on security

3. **Notifications Tab:**
   - Email Notifications toggle
   - Quiz Reminders toggle
   - Mentor Messages toggle
   - Weekly Digest toggle
   - Marketing Emails toggle (opt-in)
   - Functional toggle switches with smooth animations

4. **Appearance Tab:**
   - **2-option theme selector** (Light/Dark only)
   - Larger cards with better visual feedback
   - Active state with checkmark
   - Proper theme toggle integration

#### Result:
‚úÖ Cleaner, more focused settings page
‚úÖ Only platform-relevant features
‚úÖ Functional Light/Dark theme toggle
‚úÖ Better user experience with less confusion
‚úÖ Professional 4-tab layout

---

### 3. **Sidebar Navigation Enhancements** ‚úì

#### Problem (from previous session):
- Logo showing "CF" text badge instead of compass icon in collapsed state
- No visible toggle button to expand/collapse sidebar
- Settings link not working (page didn't exist)

#### Solution:
- Fixed logo to use `<Logo variant="icon" />` in collapsed state
- Made toggle button always visible with proper chevron icons
- Created comprehensive Settings page
- Added Settings route to App.tsx
- Improved accessibility with tooltips

#### Result:
‚úÖ Professional compass logo displays correctly
