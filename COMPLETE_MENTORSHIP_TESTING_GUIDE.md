# üöÄ COMPLETE MENTORSHIP PLATFORM TESTING GUIDE
## Step-by-Step from Fresh Start

---

## üìã PREREQUISITES

Before starting, ensure:
- [ ] Backend running on `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Frontend running on `http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Database accessible at `prisma/dev.db`
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install` in both root and frontend)

---

## üóëÔ∏è STEP 1: CLEAN UP EXISTING DATA (Start Fresh)

### 1.1 Run Cleanup Script
```bash
cd c:/Users/vamsi/careerforge-ai
node scripts/cleanupMentorData.js
```

**What it does:**
- Deletes ALL existing mentor profiles
- Deletes ALL connections, sessions, reviews
- Deletes ALL mentor-related chat rooms and messages
- Gives you a clean slate

**When prompted:** Type `DELETE ALL` to confirm

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ All mentor data has been deleted successfully!
```

---

## üë§ STEP 2: CREATE AN ADMIN USER

You need an admin account to approve mentors.

### 2.1 Check if you have an admin user

**Open SQLite database:**
```bash
# Using SQLite CLI
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db

# Run this query
SELECT id, email, name, role FROM users WHERE role = 'ADMIN';
```

**OR use this Node script:**
```bash
node -e "const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client'); const prisma = new PrismaClient(); prisma.user.findFirst({ where: { role: 'ADMIN' }}).then(user => { console.log('Admin user:', user); process.exit(0); });"
```

### 2.2 If NO admin user exists, create one

**Method 1: Update existing user to admin**
```sql
-- In SQLite CLI (sqlite3 prisma/dev.db)
UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

**Method 2: Create new admin user (if you don't have any account)**
```bash
# Register normally through frontend, then update role
# After registering, run:
sqlite3 prisma/dev.db "UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';"
```

**Verify admin creation:**
```sql
SELECT id, email, name, role FROM users WHERE role = 'ADMIN';
```

**Expected Output:**
```
clx123... | admin@example.com | Admin Name | ADMIN
```

## üö® COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

### Issue 1: "Mentor not found" (404) on reviews
**Cause:** Frontend passing wrong ID  
**Fix:** Verify `MentorProfile.tsx` line 246 uses `mentor.id` not `mentor.user.id`

### Issue 2: Mentor not visible after verification
**Cause:** Status is PENDING (needs admin approval)  
**Fix:** Run `node scripts/approveMentors.js`

### Issue 3: Admin can't access admin pages
**Cause:** User role is not ADMIN  
**Fix:** Run `UPDATE users SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';`

### Issue 4: Verification link expired
**Cause:** 24+ hours passed since registration  
**Fix:** Click "Register Again", fill form, get new link

### Issue 5: 403 errors everywhere
**Cause:** Token not stored/expired  
**Fix:** Logout and login again
