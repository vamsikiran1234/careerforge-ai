## ‚úÖ Test Plan

### Test 1: Verify Chat Storage is Cleared on Logout

**Steps:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application ‚Üí Local Storage ‚Üí http://localhost:5174
3. Login with `vamsikiran198@gmail.com`
4. Create 1-2 chat sessions
5. Check localStorage - you should see `chat-storage` key with your sessions
6. **Logout**
7. **Check localStorage again** - `chat-storage` key should be REMOVED
8. Check Console - should see: `‚úÖ Cleared chat-storage on logout to prevent data leakage`

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ `chat-storage` is completely removed from localStorage after logout

---

### Test 2: Verify No Session Leakage Between Users

**Steps:**
1. **User A Login**:
   - Login with `vamsikiran198@gmail.com`
   - Create 3-4 new chat sessions with different questions
   - Note the session titles (e.g., "Career Goals", "Software Engineering Path")
   - Verify sessions appear in left sidebar
   
2. **User A Logout**:
   - Click Logout button
   - Verify you're redirected to login page
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Check localStorage ‚Üí Verify `chat-storage` is removed

3. **User B Login**:
   - Login with a **different email** (e.g., `test@example.com` or create new account)
   - Go to AI Chat page
   - **CRITICAL CHECK**: Sidebar should be EMPTY or only show User B's own sessions
   - **VERIFY**: You should NOT see any of User A's sessions ("Career Goals", etc.)

4. **User B Create Sessions**:
   - Create 1-2 new chat sessions for User B
   - Verify only User B's sessions are visible

5. **User B Logout and User A Login Again**:
   - Logout User B
   - Login back as `vamsikiran198@gmail.com`
   - **VERIFY**: You should only see User A's original 3-4 sessions
   - You should NOT see User B's sessions

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Each user only sees their own chat sessions, no cross-user data leakage

---

### Test 3: Verify Console Logs

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Login as any user
3. Go to AI Chat page
4. Check console logs - should see:
   ```
   LoadSessions: Starting to load sessions...
   LoadSessions: API response: ...
   LoadSessions: Validated sessions: X sessions
   LoadSessions: Final merged sessions count: X
   ```

5. Logout
6. Check console - should see:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Cleared chat-storage on logout to prevent data leakage
   ```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Console logs confirm proper data clearing and loading

---

### Test 4: Verify API Returns Correct Sessions

**Steps:**
1. Login as `vamsikiran198@gmail.com`
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
3. Go to AI Chat page
4. Find request to `/api/v1/chat/sessions`
5. Check response:
   - Should only contain sessions for current user
   - Verify `userId` field matches current user

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ API only returns sessions belonging to the authenticated user

---

### Test 5: Verify Temporary Sessions Are Preserved

**Steps:**
1. Login as any user
2. Start typing a message in AI Chat (don't send)
3. Refresh the page
4. Check if the unsent message is still there
5. Logout and login again
6. Verify the temporary session is gone

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Temporary sessions work correctly but don't leak between users

---

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ SUCCESS Indicators:
- `chat-storage` is removed from localStorage on logout
- Each user only sees their own chat sessions
- Console shows "Cleared chat-storage on logout"
- LoadSessions logs show correct session counts
- No mixing of sessions between users

### ‚ùå FAILURE Indicators:
- `chat-storage` remains in localStorage after logout
- User B sees User A's chat sessions
- Session count is higher than expected
- Sessions from previous user appear in sidebar
- Console errors related to session loading

---

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Frontend not updating
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear browser cache

### Issue 2: Still seeing old sessions
**Solution**: 
1. Manually clear localStorage:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   ```
2. Restart browser
3. Login again

### Issue 3: Backend returning wrong sessions
**Solution**: Check backend logs, verify JWT token, check user ID

## üéØ Quick Test Script

If you want to test quickly, run this in the browser console:

```javascript
// 1. Check if chat-storage exists
console.log('Chat Storage:', localStorage.getItem('chat-storage'));

// 2. After logout, verify it's cleared
console.log('After Logout - Chat Storage:', localStorage.getItem('chat-storage'));
// Should log: null

// 3. Check all localStorage keys
console.log('All localStorage keys:', Object.keys(localStorage));

// 4. Manual clear if needed (for testing)
localStorage.removeItem('chat-storage');
console.log('‚úÖ Manually cleared chat-storage');
```
